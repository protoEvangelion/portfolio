## Master Tips

> Always, always, always favor **readability**. If it is a bottleneck to perf come back and fix it later

**Stability** is something you want to keep in mind when picking an algo

- If there is a bug in your code, think of where you are lacking in understanding because the root of bugs is where your brain diverges from how the computer actually works ~ Kyle Simpson

- The more imperitavely you write code, the more you actually make it harder for the engine to optimize your code ~ Kyle Simpson

- Code that you cannot understand is code that you cannot trust...the reverse is also true ~ Kyle Simpson

- There is one thing that computers will never be better than us at--communicating empathetically with humans ~ Kyle Simpson

- Our goal when writing code, is to write it so clearly that a developer can understand what your program does on their first pass ~ Kyle Simpson

- As is relates to FP es6 was a push to give us more declarative tools to write our code so we can think about the bigger picture! ~ Kyle Simpson

### Algos are all about **tradeoffs**

> **Pro Tip** If you cannot see the variable on the same page, "redeclare it" so the reader knows exactly what scope it belongs to

## Pair Programming

- A secret to growing into a junior or senior level engineer
- Hard learning is where you grow the most
- **Hard Learning Spectrum**
  1.  _The Researcher Trap_
  - Doing the hard work but you just get stuck researching and never get to coding
  2.  _The StackOverflow Approach_
  - Take snippet try it, it doesn't work, try another snippet......
- Pair programming solves the hard learning dilema
