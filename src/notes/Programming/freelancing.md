## Process

### Gathering Requirements

- Probably the most important part of the process.
- If you botch this, you'll be dealing with change orders and scope-creep throughout the entire project.
- Poor planning is why agencies have project managers and why many freelancers hate their clients.
- Ask lots of questions
- Get lots of examples
- Break down each page into functionality
- Ask about **budget**
- Clarify who will be updating the site
- Do these things in person if possible

### Figuring out the quote

- Break it down into major functional areas that don't necessarily depend on each other.
- **Multi-staged** quotes are great because if it's too expensive, the client knows they can add additional features later in the project.
- Explain the tech you will use in relation to how it will help their business, or how easy it will be for them to manage.

#### Presenting the quote

- List what will be included
- List what won't be included
- Make your quote valid for **two weeks**
- Create a template that looks professional
- Our agency had a professional template, printed on heavy paper in an embossed folder with our logo on it.
  - You don't have to go this far, but experience matters. Think Apple. You can quote more if you have a higher perception of quality.

### Timelines

- Timelines should include **hard dates**.
- You should have a "hard on" and and "hard off".
- Assume 24-hour turnaround on questions
- Be generous with your estimates. Under promise, over deliver.
- Quoting time is a huge skill

### Contract

- You best have one
- Spell out what the client is getting (from quote)
- At the very least, have the client sign your quote
- Clear communication and a good relationship is extremely important
- Use online templates, or have a lawyer create something specific

### Setting Expectations

- Don't make yourself available 24/7
- Establish a professional environment by not being too casual
- Your choices will set the course for your relationship
- Don't be too quick to reply to email
- Schedule emails for 10 a.m.

### Design

- **Collect all assets** from your client
  - Logo
  - Brand guidelines
  - List of likes and dislikes
    - try to understand type of company
    - make person happy with overall vibe
- Create initial look and feel
- Don't show client **too early**—they can be distracted by little unfinished things
  - a practical idea for this is to push up one feature at a time and request feedback on it
- Back up the "whys" of what you did.
  - Otherwise, it's just a pretty picture and and the client only thinks about it in terms of taste.
  - Remember, you are the expert they hired, so it's not totally subjective—you have the expertise and you need to flex that.
    - This button is teal because it's your call to action—this is the button that makes you money so we want to highlight that
    - Grey text on white background is hard to read—you'll be leaving people out if you do this.
- Be prepared for non-standard feedback
  - E.g. this feels cloudy, can it look more sunny? Please make it pop, etc.
  - Don't get offended by feedback on creative work
  - Clients didn't go to art school and don't know about good feedback.
  - Clients will ignore all finished aspects of a design and only focus on the one minor thing that's incorrect.

### Development

- **Clear requirements** make development much easier.
  - if you spec out all the parts of design it will be much easier to dev
- Sometimes this starts at the same time or in the process of design.
- Only show dev progress if client is capable of understanding dev process.
  - Showing a developed site too early can cause clients to worry about visual aspects that aren't yet in line with the design.
  - Showing to early is also a recipe for a feedback list of things you already know.
- Give regular **progress updates**, as previously established.
  - Make it happen on a schedule so expectations are set and so you won't forget.
  - Stick to your timeline!
- Clients don't care about technical jargon.
  - Don't tell clients about Gatsby/React as much as telling them about the benefits, how fast the site is, etc.

### Feedback and revisions

- Feedback is done in revisions or **rounds**.
- For **smaller** projects, have your client email (one email) a list of feedback.
- For **larger** projects, and more technical clients, use bug tracking software, such as Github issues, Trello, etc.
- Write down everything, and then have a **follow-up call to discuss the feedback**.

### Deployment

- Get your client to pay for domains and hosting.
- Make sure their old website has everything off of it, or host the website somewhere else.
- If you're moving servers, best to just point the A records at the new server.
- If changing nameservers for DNS, make sure the client doesn't have:
  - email
  - files
    - Many clients use their server to uploaded PDFs and other files that may still need to be accessible.
  - other apps on that server that will be nuked or broken when moving
- If you are changing URL structure, you'll need to be aware of any redirects.
- **Backup** strategies
  - GitHub could be enough
  - It could be a plugin in WordPress or Drupal
  - It could be on a chron job
- **Restoration** strategies
  - how do you get back up and running as fast as possible

### Handoff

- turn off anything they don't need
  - it's pretty easy to do this in WordPress
  - lock down plugins if they don't need access
- Create a video detailing how to do each thing
- Don't give more options than they need in the back end.
- Do in-person training when possible.
- Only teach them the things that are important for their day to day usage.

### Bug fixes and support

- Very common for clients with wrong idea of project guidelines to want to add on at the end of a project.
- Not about adding new, non-established features.
- Emergency bugs require an emergency response if they are your fault
  - you should fix these immediately if you caused this.
- **Set expectations** and be careful what you promise.

### What to do when things go to shit

- There should be a trail of communication leading up to things going awry.
- Try to mitigate things while they are small problems
  - Don't wait until they snowball
- Project is behind.
- Product is not met with acceptance.
  - This is something that should have been recognized in requirements
  - you should have drawn this out of your client earlier
- Client isn't paying.
- When to fire your client.
  - When they break the contract multiple times
  - when they don't do what you agreed upon

## Branding

### Generalist or Specialist

- You can choose to brand yourself as having a specialty
  - Profit margins are higher here
- Or you can brand yourself as the guy who builds websites
- You also have to ask yourself if you want to run the business aspect of things or someone else too

### Billing & Pricing

- value based piecemeal billing is more preferred than hourly billing
  - fixed base billing
  - this is a skill that you learn as you go along
- If the scope of the work is really fuzzy, then hourly based billing works fine
- Be comfortable talking about money
  - talk about what you think a feature will cost
  - it's ok to go back and forth
