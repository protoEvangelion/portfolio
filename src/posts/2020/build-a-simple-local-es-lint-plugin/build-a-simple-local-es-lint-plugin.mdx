Motivation
==========

Do you want to build a local eslint plugin for your project without publishing it to npm? Then follow these simple steps to get started.

Simple Setup Steps
==================

1.  Install generators`npm install -g yo generator-eslint`

2.  Create a directory at root of your project like `eslint-rules`

3.  cd into it & run `yo eslint:plugin` & follow prompts

4.  Run `yo eslint:rule` to set up your first rule

5.  cd back to root of your project

6.  Add your new plugin as a local npm package: `yarn add --dev file:./eslint-rules`

7.  Configure your rule in your eslint config however you named it in the prompts:

```javascript
rules: {
        'your-local-npm-package-name/your-rule-name': [
            'error',
            {
                foo: 'bar'
            }
        ]
}
```

Bonus
-----

For fast iteration on your your new rule, you will need to add some **npm symlinks**. If you don't, then every time you customize your rule, you will have to re `npm install`. Adding the symlinks is a simple two step process:

1.  cd into your local plugin dir & run `npm link`

2.  cd back to the root of your project & run `npm link your-local-npm-package-name`

Now every time you make a change, it will automatically be applied next time ESLint runs!
