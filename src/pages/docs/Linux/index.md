* Unix was originally built for large *mainframe computers* that people would use at the same time
* Every program on UNIX system read input from *standard input devide (stdin)* and write to *standard output (stdout)*
  * The big idea is that rather than type everything yourself, you can have the computer **type for you**
  * There were terminals and you ran your commands which "printed out" your stuff to an actual printer
