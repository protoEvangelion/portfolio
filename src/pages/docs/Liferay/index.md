## TLDR;

### Changes

* Access to **modern JS** features (ES6)
* Way forward to atomic design is via **Lexicon/Clay** (lots of promise there)
* ***Node & Npm***! Need I say more?
* **Gulp tasks** in our theme to speed up deployment and gives us the facility to integrate new steps into the build process like adding [autoprefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io/) for automagic vendor prefixing
* Sass **Bourbon** mixins
* Out of the box **SVG icons** & font awesome
* **Yeoman** generator to scaffold theme and template related tasks
* [**Themelets**](https://dev.liferay.com/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/themelets) which can be npm packages that you pull into theme
* No more **eye icon** to show and hide admin settings
* **Importing** Lar files is really easy now
* **Searching** for templates is better
* **UI is easier & faster** to customize web content, templates, structures
* Cool **simulation feature** for checking design responsiveness
* Recommendation is to **[not use Alloy UI](http://alloyui.com/rosetta-stone/)** for any new development (they've actually included **jQuery** lol)
* DXP requires **Java 8**
